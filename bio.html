  <br/>

  <br/>

  <p>This is the first paragraph about me. Since it's my biography, maybe I'd talk about myself personally. I've lived in Nashville for 13 years. I live in the Nippers Corner area with my dog, Benzie. She's training to become a service dog. I enjoy hiking, being involved in my church, and spending time with friends.</p>
  <br/>

  <p>This is the second paragraph. Perhaps I'd talk about myself professionally. Over the last nine years of my career, my involvement in data and systems has evolved and grown to where I am now, with a strong interest in gaining formal skills so I can advance my career in data. I currently work at Sarah Cannon Cancer Research Institute in their finance department on the cash applications team.</p>
